Add cross-project backup and restore functionality in the Velero GCP Plugin.

The main changes include:
Replaced compute.Disks.CreateSnapshot with compute.Snapshots.insert to enable cross-project snapshots.
Configured the volumeProject to use the project from the provided GCP credentials and snapshotProject to use the project from the plugin configuration.
